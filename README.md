INTRO
-----

This program uses the older Applied Cryptography example program to generate 
a SDES and TDES functionality. These are arranged in a series if actions to 
'proof' the capability of crypto on a platform. This particular version should
require no extraneous libs, it is self-contained. I would not base any modern 
code on this but it can be used to prove that des crypt can run on a platform.

INSTALLING
----------
